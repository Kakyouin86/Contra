Changes to do in each new update:

--> Corgi Engine\Common\Scripts\Environment\Ladder.cs Line 14 should be:
public enum LadderTypes { Simple, BiDirectional, Horizontal } //Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update.

--> Corgi Engine\Common\Scripts\Agents\CorgiController\CharacterWallClinging.cs Line 20 should be:
[Range(0.0000000001f, 1)]//Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update. it was 0.01f originally. With this small value, you can't detach from the wall.

--> Corgi Engine\Common\Scripts\Agents\CorgiController\CharacterLadder.cs line 79 should be:
//_boxCollider = this.gameObject.GetComponentInParent<BoxCollider2D>();//Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update.
GameObject ladderColliderObject = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("LadderCollider");//Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update. This adds the collider of the Ladder Collider only.
if (ladderColliderObject != null)//Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update. This adds the collider of the Ladder Collider only.
{
_boxCollider = ladderColliderObject.GetComponent<BoxCollider2D>();//Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update. This adds the collider of the Ladder Collider only.
}

--> Corgi Engine\Common\Scripts\Agents\Weapons\WeaponAim.cs line 23 should be:

public int originalProjectiles ;//Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update.

--> Corgi Engine\Common\Scripts\Agents\Weapons\WeaponAim.cs line 163 should be:

originalProjectiles = projectileWeapon.ProjectilesPerShot; //Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update.

--> Corgi Engine\Common\Scripts\Agents\Weapons\WeaponAim.cs line 451 should be:
// if the rotation speed is == 0, we have instant rotation
if (WeaponRotationSpeed == 0 && oldRotation != newRotation) //Leo Monge: Need to ALWAYS bring it after update.
{

}
// otherwise we lerp the rotation
else if (WeaponRotationSpeed != 0)
{
